# GEE Zonal

**GEE Zonal**: This python package provides a wrapper function to request temporal and zonal statistics from Google Earth Engine (GEE) datasets.

## Summary

A zonal statistics function was created to ease the process of working with the GEE API. The function can work with any raster data loaded to EE (`ee.ImageCollections` or `ee.Image`) and vector features (`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` or `ee.FeatureCollection`), and returns tabular data.

Statistics can be requested at various temporal resolutions (`original` frequency, `monthly`, or `annual`). The workflow conducts pixel-by-pixel temporal aggregations, before summarizing statistics over target features.

Additionaly, the package provides functionality to quickly search the GEE Catalog.
